**Customer Churn Prediction App**
A machine learning–powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their service usage, contract type, payment method, and demographic information etc using Logistics Regression and Artificial Neural Network.

This project covers the end-to-end churn prediction pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaning, encoding, scaling
2. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network
3. **Model Evaluation** – accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve
4. **Prediction Interface** – interactive form for customer churn prediction

The app provides insights into customer behavior and can be used by businesses to identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies

NB: pip install reuirerments.txt and use "streamlit run MachineLearning" to open the app
